# Repaire du Web - Contest #3

## 404 page

Create an original 404 page

### My goals

I've tried in the past to use three.js library (for the [product page contest](https://github.com/Atthis/RdW_concours_product-page), but I didn't reach my goals: create a 3d product with which we can interact, and change color. It was certainly to much to learn from a completely new technology for me.

I decide to create a panoramic view for the page background this time, which allowed me to dive again into three.js. I took time to better understand some core concepts.

From this moving background, I've create an entire brand identity to design the entire page.

### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Three.JS

### Challenges

I'll try to make the moving background effect responsive, i.e. dealing with touch events.
